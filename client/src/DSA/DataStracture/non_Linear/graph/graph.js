            In data structures, graphs are a collection of nodes or vertices
            connected by edges. They are used to represent relationships and
            connections between different elements, allowing for efficient
            modelling and analysis of complex systems. Graphs provide a powerful
            framework for solving problems in various domains, such as network
            analysis, social media analysis, and route planning. Let's
            understand more!
            <br />
            <br />
            Let us understand what is a graph in the data structure. Graphs are
            non-linear data structures comprising a set of nodes (or vertices),
            connected by edges (or arcs). Nodes are entities where the data is
            stored, and their relationships are expressed using edges. Edges may
            be directed or undirected. Graphs easily demonstrate complicated
            relationships and are used to solve many real-life problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, Facebook uses a graph data structure comprising a group
            of entities and their relationships. On Facebook, every user, photo,
            post, page, place, etc., that has data is represented with a node.
            Every edge from one node to another represents their relationships,
            friendships, ownerships, tags, etc. Whenever a user posts a photo,
            comments on a post, etc., a new edge is created for that
            relationship. Both nodes and edges have meta-data associated with
            them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Graphs are powerful data structures that represent real-life
            relationships between entities. Graphs are used everywhere, from
            social networks, Google Maps, and the World Wide Web to blockchains
            and neural networks. Due to their ability to provide abstractions to
            real life, they are used in various practical problems. This article
            will dive deep into graphs in the data structure, their types,
            terminologies, operations, representation, and applications.

                Graph traversal is visiting or updating each vertex in a graph.
                The order in which they visit the vertices classifies the
                traversals. There are two ways to implement a graph traversal:

                    operation that horizontally traverses the graph. It
                    traverses all the nodes at a single level before moving to
                    the next level. It begins at the graphâ€™s root and traverses
                    all the nodes at a single depth level before moving on to
                    the next level.
