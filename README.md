### __3.2.5.	Error Handling and Validation__
Error handling and validation are crucial aspects of any robust system, especially when dealing with sensitive information such as user passwords. In the context of bcrypt and password hashing, it's essential to handle exceptions related to the hashing process. This includes scenarios where the bcrypt library encounters errors during password hashing or comparison. In the provided Node.js example, error handling is implemented within the callback functions of __bcrypt.hash__ and __bcrypt.compare.__ The system should appropriately log or handle these errors to ensure that issues, such as the inability to hash a password, are addressed and communicated effectively.

Furthermore, the system should implement validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of user passwords. This involves validating the input before initiating the hashing process, checking for conditions such as minimum password length or the presence of specific characters. Additionally, the system should enforce proper access controls and authentication processes to prevent unauthorized access to password-related functionalities. Validation mechanisms should be designed to handle edge cases and provide clear error messages to users in case of validation failures, helping them understand and rectify the issues.

The proposed system will have two (2) databases for recovery and backup. One for a copy of the original database used for a backup purpose that is used for recovery if the original database fails. 
### __3.2.8.	Resource Issues__ 
The system needs resources that have high processor speed and memory for server and client
### __3.2.9.	Documentation__ 
Our system will have well-defined documents which help to easily maintain the system. We will also prepare a short and understandable file for users on how to use the system. And the development process will be provided for the user to read to know about the process and what type of model used to develop the system
